# Containers-communication
In this repository, I have undertaken the task of deploying a Flask application and an SQL database in separate containers while establishing communication between the two.

Clone the Repository - ```git clone https://github.com/SathwikReddyM/Containers-communication```

Open the terminal and navigate to the cloned folder

Run the docker-compose file - ```docker-compose up --build```


Access the application at ```localhost:5000```

Access the database at ```localhost:3307```

To test the data being added without connecting to the database run test.py in the flask container.

Read and Write statements are tested
